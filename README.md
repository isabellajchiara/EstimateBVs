# EstimateBVs

The goal of this repo is to train a genomic prediction model using the rrblup function mixed.solve() and estimate breeding values of our selection candidates. 

Open the script called rrblup.r

Use trainingdata.xlsx to train the model.

Use Candidates.xlsx to predict breeding values of the candidates.
